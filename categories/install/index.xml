Twitch died again :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor the environment.
Use these tools. * Linux: strace and ltrace. * On Windows : Process Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example from a CTF.
Mixer: It needed a certain library. So you have to install all dependencies. Use “ldd” to check if you have everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable.
readelf -l binaryname
will show us which loader is needed for this library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It loaded the application in GDB but could not debug.
Two solutions: 1. Attach after running, bad idea. 2. Manually enter CC CC at EP by ediuting the hex. 3. Then run it in GDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to analyze everything - probably the most important thing when doing RE
If you have a blackbox with a small-ish input/output space, let it run and look at output to find out what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool might be wrong. Check the output.
Entropy is a good recon tool.
Know Crypto and other stuff and be able to recognize it.
I asked him for an alternative to IDA pro for x64 binaries. He didn’t have any alternatives as he uses IDA Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
