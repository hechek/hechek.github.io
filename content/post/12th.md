It’s been a while since Burp part four and I want to continue writing these. It’s time to actually proxy applications. However I have three problems: I was too busy at work. I could not find a lot of interesting applications that are interesting to proxy and can showcase different Burp functionalities that we talked about. I found some interesting applications but there were security vulns so I am going through disclosure (unfortunately I may never be able to release them publicly).
